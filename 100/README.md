# 100 - Introduction

## BabylonJS

Babylon is a game development framework, or perhaps more accurately a "3D application framework," built in and for Javascript. While leveraging WebGL directly, or libraries such as ThreeJS is certainly feasible, Babylon provides framework features that cover the other bases aside from plain rendering as well - such as shader processing, loading transitions, network functionality, input handling, handling audio, loading objects and producing full "scenes," which you should interpret as "maps" within this context.

## Quasar

Quasar is a solution for packaging and deploying any Javascript or Typescript application on any platform. Quasar 2 employs Vue 3 as a frontend library, comes with its own UI elements that match the Material Design spec, and packages its application using Electron on desktop, Cordova on Mobile, and plain old Javascript bundles for web use.
