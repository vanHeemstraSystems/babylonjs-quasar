# 400 - Step 4: Loading a model

For this step we'll be loading a 3D model of a house to demonstrate our application in action. We're sourcing the model from [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org/), specifically the "Stellwerk-A" package made available to the public domain by **Brylie Christopher Oxley**, and all credit for the artwork should go to them.

The package can be downloaded from: https://opengameart.org/content/stellwerk-a

Let's begin by downloading this package and unpacking the file. From here we'll create a directory called "assets" in our ```containers/app/babylonjs/public``` directory, and copy our files over.

**NOTE**: Before being able to upload the above model, due to size restrictions, we upload a model called ```lego_baseplate_48x48_4186_dark_grey.gltf``` in the meantime.
