# 200 - Step 2: Adding Electron

See https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/developing-electron-apps/preparation/

While Quasar does support Electron, it does not come with Electron configured nor installed. So let's do this now. Navigate to the project directory, and enter the following command from ```containers/app/babylonjs/```:

```
$ quasar mode add electron
```
